I've been working as a JVM Sustaining Engineering at Oracle since 2020. I've previously worked as a Java developer within telecom and speech recognition. In the sustaining team I work on many areas of the Java Virtual Machine, ranging from garbage collection casualties, flight recorder investigations, to compiler-related wrongdoings. In my sparetime I've also worked with the GNU Classpath and other Java virtual machines over the years, trying to (with some success) [port a JVM](https://jamiga2.blogspot.com) to obscure operating systems (Amiga!).
