So I’ve been poking at Xena. I’ve had this idea for the longest to do something with the chip. The biggest obstacle has however been actually compiling anything that runs on it. On various occasions I’ve set up the Xmos developer environment, but it’s always been a cumbersome moving of files and it has just taken the energy away from actually trying out some stuff.

Now, however, finally I’ve managed to get something working. Introducing Gabrielle! It’s Xena's companion, always there to help! It’s basically a script that sends off the files to compile to a compilation server. The compilation server in turn — aptly named Sai — collects the source files and compiles them into a xe binary, ready to be run with the XRunXE command.

It’s as easy as this:
‘’’
gabrielle TARGET=wiggle.xe wiggle.xc
XRunXE wiggle.xe
‘’’
